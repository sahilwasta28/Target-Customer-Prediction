# Target-Customer-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of their engagement.
The primary goal is to assist businesses in targeting their marketing efforts more effectively.
Used Logistic Regression and Decision Tree machine learning models to predict the behavior of customer (demographics) and evaluated the outcome of whether the customer will buy the insurance policies. 

**Features :**  
1) Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw customer data for analysis.
2) Feature Engineering: Extracts and selects relevant features to improve model performance.
3) Model Training: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.
4) Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5) Prediction: Provides predictions on customer engagement based on the trained model.

**Technologies Used :**
1) Programming Language: Python
2) Libraries/Frameworks: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
3) Data Storage: CSV files (train.csv)
4) Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
